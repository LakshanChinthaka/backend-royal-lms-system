3. **Scalable Deployment: Backend deployed on AWS EC2, with the database on AWS RDS, ensuring scalability and reliability.
4. **Entity Management: CRUD operations for entities like Student, Course, Batch, etc.
5. **Course Enrollment: Allows assigning subjects to courses and enrolling students in courses and batches.
6. **Email Integration: Facility to send emails integrated within the system.
7. **Data Visualization: Utilizes Pie, Bar, and Line charts to visualize assignment, student, and system data.
8. **Admin Dashboard: Real-time display of total students, subjects, schools, assignments, and pass rates
9. **Monitoring and Metrics: Tracks 200, 400, 404, 500 HTTP request count, error count, CPU, RAM, and database status using Spring Boot Actuator.
10. **Exception Handling: Custom exception handling for better error management.
11. **Performance Optimization: Implements pagination to improve API performance.
12. **Frontend Interaction: Axios for API data fetch, with state management in React using useState, useEffect, and Context.
13. **Responsive Design: All interfaces are designed to be responsive for optimal viewing across devices.
