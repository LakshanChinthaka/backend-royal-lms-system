# Learning Management System (Back-end)

### Used Technology -  Spring boot | React | MySQL | Firebase | AWS RDS & EC2 | TailwindCSS

Welcome to our GitHub repository! This educational management system enables students to upload and download assignment files, assigns subjects to courses, and allows flexible student enrollment. The database handles various entity relationships, and SQL native queries facilitate data retrieval. Custom exceptions enhance system reliability, and Map Struct streamlines entity-DTO mapping. The use of reusable code reduces duplication, and ResponseEntity ensures standardized user responses. Swagger 2 is integrated for easy API interaction, and CRUD operations are implemented for students, courses, assignments, subjects, and addresses. Explore our repository for more details!
